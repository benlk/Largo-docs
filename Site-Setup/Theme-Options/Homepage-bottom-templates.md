The Largo theme offers three options for the bottom of the homepage, beneath the [[Homepage top template]]. These are set in the Customizer or in *Appearance &gt; Theme Options &gt; Layout Options &gt; Homepage Bottom*.
## List

A single-column list of recent posts with photos and excerpts. 

## Widgets

This creates a two-column widget area and adds it to the list of [[sidebars and widgets|Sidebars and widgets]], allowing you to filter posts with custom taxonomy widgets. If you want to have posts from multiple categories below the main post, this is the way to go. 

## None

This option puts no posts beneath the top template on the homepage. Choose your top template carefully.

The code for these is set in `/home.php`.
