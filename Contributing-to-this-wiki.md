# Stylebook

## General style

Every page has a header-on `h1` element, which in Markdown is a line starting with a `# `. Refer to the page in writing by this headline title. 

Directories are named in Title Case with dashes joining words..

    Directory-Name
    A-Very-Long-Directory-Name
    Name

Files are named in sentence case with dashes separating words. Dashes will be stripped from the filename and used as the wiki article name. The file extension will be stripped and the file name will become the URL of that page in the wiki. 

    This-is-a-Wiki-Page.md    <- Filename
    This is a Wiki Page       <- Article name
    This-is-a-Wiki-Page       <- URL


## Typography

`h2` and below use sentence case, unless it's a proper noun:

	## This header is not in title case

	## Official Plugin Name is a proper noun
